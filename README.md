# Infosys Springboard Internship Project Journey

Welcome to the **Infosys Springboard Internship Project Journey** repository! This repository is a comprehensive log of my path through the Infosys Springboard internship, capturing my learnings, implementations, and growth across multiple milestones. The focus of this project is to develop an **innovative system volume-control application using hand gestures**, merging computer vision with gesture-based interaction.

---

## 🚀 Internship Snapshot

Throughout my internship, I am embracing hands-on experience with:

- **OpenCV** for image analysis and processing
- **MediaPipe** for real-time hand detection and landmark tracking
- **PyCAW** for controlling system audio volume in Python
- **PyCharm** as my primary development environment

My journey is ongoing—I am currently conquering **Milestone 3**: integrating gesture-based controls for system volume.

This repository features:

- **Jupyter Notebooks** with step-by-step hands-on experimentation
- **Presentations (PPTs)** summarizing concepts, challenges, and progress for each milestone

## 🛠️ Project Milestones

### Milestone 1: Webcam Input & Hand Detection

- Capture video stream from webcam
- Detect hands in real-time using MediaPipe
- Identify and extract hand landmarks
- Lay groundwork for future gesture-based controls

### Milestone 2: Gesture Recognition & Distance Calculation

- Recognize gestures from hand landmark positions
- Measure distances between key fingers (e.g., thumb and index)
- Decode gesture logic for system interaction

### Milestone 3: Volume Mapping & Control (In Progress)

- Translate finger distance to system volume values
- Integrate **PyCAW** for audio control
- Achieve responsive, smooth volume changes based on gesture input

### Milestone 4: User Interface & Feedback

- Develop feedback indicators (visual bars, icons)
- Design a simple, effective user interface for gesture volume control
- Focus on usability and intuitive interaction

---

## 🎯 Objective

The end goal is to deliver a **gesture-based system volume controller** that empowers users to adjust their device’s audio with a simple movement of their fingers — combining:

- Webcam video input
- Real-time hand tracking
- Gesture interpretation
- Seamless system volume adjustment
